# Desktop captures

`dist/assets/fungos-{workspace,desktop,terminal}.png` are untouched 1280×800
framebuffer captures of `fungos-edge-qemu-01` on Agora, 6 October 2026. The native
Canvas Wayland/KMS compositor owns the display; the applications are real Weston
Wayland terminals. No window, app content or feature UI was composited into them.
Each image has a matching `.provenance.txt` with capture time, source revision,
transport and PNG SHA256. Capture used read-only loopback VNC because the live
stream owner held QMP. The frozen fungal background is original procedural
artwork rendered from `fungOS/edge/theme/render-undergrowth.rs` in Mycelium;
no third-party Shadertoy source was copied. Cursor assets are distribution-owned
`xcursor-themes`; their attribution remains in the guest's
`/usr/share/doc/xcursor-themes/copyright`.
